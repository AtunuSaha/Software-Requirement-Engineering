📄 Project Overview: Paying Guest Management System – Software Requirement Specification
Paying Guest Management System is a web-based platform conceptualized to streamline the accommodation process for hosts and guests. This project was developed as part of a Software Requirement Engineering course to define and document the system’s functionality, user roles, constraints, and design elements through a structured Software Requirements Specification (SRS).

The SRS focuses on capturing detailed system requirements, such as room posting, booking management, payment processing, and user registration. It also includes non-functional requirements, UI/UX prototypes, UML diagrams, and a complete data dictionary to support development planning and stakeholder understanding.

This project includes:

📋 A detailed Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document

🧑‍💻 Functional and non-functional requirement breakdown

🧭 User roles and system workflows

🗂️ UML diagrams, E-R diagrams, and data dictionary

🎨 UI/UX design prototypes

The goal was to ensure the software system is clearly defined, feasible, and aligned with business needs before development, minimizing risks and improving communication between stakeholders and developers.
